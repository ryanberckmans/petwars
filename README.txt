
Petwars Upcoming Features
=========================

- after a battle, the losing pet receives 50% more points than the winning pet, but no xp. The winning pet's reward is unmodified.  E.g. for a level 1 fight, the winning pet receives 4 points and the losing pet 6 points.
- toggleshow is ON by default, because the prompt is immersive
- ? if Bob challenges fred, and Fred challenges Bob (instead of accepting), the challenge is automatically accepted.  This is just Quality of Life.
- ? petwars shouldn't chatserve /emoteall and /roomall by players, since usually they are on the same chatserver elsewhere
- ? option to mute battles if you're not in it, default OFF. Would require reworking /roomall
- ? doesn't respond if you challenge someone who has already been challenged, but hasn't yet accepted.

Class-specific issues
=====================

- thief backstab has a bug in the damage math and does 0 damage, I think. Needs testing
- cleric and mages cast no spells or have any visible abilities of any kind
