Petwars Upcoming Features
=========================

- toggleshow is ON by default, because the prompt is immersive
- ? if Bob challenges fred, and Fred challenges Bob (instead of accepting), the challenge is automatically accepted.  This is just Quality of Life.
- ? petwars shouldn't chatserve /emoteall and /roomall by players, since usually they are on the same chatserver elsewhere
- ? option to mute battles if you're not in it, default OFF. Would require reworking /roomall
- ? doesn't respond if you challenge someone who has already been challenged, but hasn't yet accepted.

Class-specific issues
